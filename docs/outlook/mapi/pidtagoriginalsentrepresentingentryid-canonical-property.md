A client application sending a message on behalf of another client should set this property to the value of the **PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_ENTRYID** ([PidTagSentRepresentingEntryId](pidtagsentrepresentingentryid-canonical-property.md)) property at the first submission of the message. Once set, it should never be changed.
